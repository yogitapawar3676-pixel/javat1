Basic Calculator (Java)

This is a simple Java program that works like a basic calculator. It can perform simple math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user just needs to enter two numbers and choose the operator. The program will then show the result.

How it works

When you run the program, it will:

Ask you to enter the first number.

Ask for the operator (+, -, *, /).

Ask for the second number.

Then it will calculate and display the result.
If you try to divide a number by zero, it will show an error message.

Example
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5
Result: 50.0

Steps to run the program

Open any Java IDE (like NetBeans, Eclipse, or IntelliJ) or use Command Prompt.

Save the file with the name BasicCalculator.java.

Compile the program using:

javac BasicCalculator.java


Then run it using:

java BasicCalculator

Future improvements

In the future, this calculator can be improved by:

Adding more operations like square root, power, and percentage

Making a graphical version using Java Swing

Handling more user input errors
